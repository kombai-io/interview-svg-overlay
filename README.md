## Instructions

* This is a next.js template. Run `npm run dev` to run the dev server
* The project by default renders the svg in `data/sample1.svg.js` in the file `pages/index.tsx`
* Your task is to use `data/sample1.json` which contains a set of nested boxes, draw those boxes on screen on top of the SVG being rendered, to create a result which looks like `data/result1.jpeg`

Good Luck!
